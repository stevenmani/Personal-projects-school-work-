# Cybersecurity Projects & Reports Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio repository. This collection contains various practical lab reports, security audits, and academic seminar presentations that document my ongoing learning journey in cybersecurity and computer science at Auchi Polytechnic. 

These documents demonstrate foundational hands-on experience with access controls, incident response, vulnerability assessments, and technology management.

##  Repository Contents

### 1. Security Audits & Compliance
* **Security Audit on Botium Toys:** A comprehensive controls and compliance checklist evaluating a fictional company's adherence to major regulatory standards.
    * Assesses current security controls against best practices for PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC (type 1 and 2).
    * Includes recommendations for implementing the principle of least privilege, strict password policies, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

### 2. Incident Response & Threat Analysis
* **Incident Report Analysis:** A detailed breakdown of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack involving an ICMP flood.
    * Applies the NIST framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to document the attack timeline and mitigation strategies.
    * Explores solutions like rate-limiting firewall rules, source IP verification, and IDS/IPS implementation.

### 3. Practical Lab Reports
* **Apply Filters to SQL Queries:** A practical investigation using SQL queries to retrieve security-related datasets from a MariaDB database.
    * Demonstrates the use of `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` operators to filter suspicious after-hours login attempts and identify specific employee machines.
* **File Permissions in Linux:** A hands-on lab report detailing the management of file and directory authorizations in a Linux environment.
    * Utilizes command-line tools like `ls -l`, `ls -a`, and `chmod` to review and modify read, write, and execute permissions for users, groups, and others (including hidden files).

### 4. Risk & Vulnerability Assessments
* **Vulnerability Assessment Report:** An analysis of a Linux-based MySQL database server to identify potential threat sources like data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
    * Outlines remediation strategies such as role-based access controls, TLS encryption for data in motion, and IP allow-listing.
* **Security Risk Assessment Report:** A brief strategy document recommending core network hardening tools, including firewall configuration, multi-factor authentication, and frequent patch updates.

### 5. Academic Seminars & Presentations
* **Managing Emerging Technology Environment:** A seminar presentation exploring the characteristics, impacts, and risks of evolving technologies like AI, IoT, and Cloud Computing.
    * Covers strategies for managing these environments, such as continuous training, strong cybersecurity measures, and compliance with legal requirements.
* **Securing, Monitoring, and Evaluating Data:** A presentation outlining the continuous loop of digital hygiene required to protect organizational data.
    * Discusses perimeter defense (Encryption, IAM, Data Masking), system observation (SIEM tools, Audit Trails), and assessing data value and compliance.

##  Skills Demonstrated
* **Command Line & Scripting:** Linux file system management, SQL database querying.
* **Security Frameworks:** Practical application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
* **Compliance:** Understanding of GDPR, PCI DSS, and SOC regulations.
* **Risk Management:** Threat modeling, vulnerability identification, and mitigation planning.
